# Subspace Relation Learning for Cross-modal Hashing
These are the codes of the **Subspace Relation Learning for Cross-modal Hashing (SRLCH)** method in our paper "*Index and Retrieve Multimedia Data: Cross-modal Hashing by Learning Subspace Relation*" , which has been accepted as a full research paper by DASFAA2018.

You can run the `test_demo.m` to start learning binary codes for cross-modal data and evaluate them. A small-scale dataset Wiki is also available for this demo in the `dataset` folder.
